Description: Data with irregular spatial support, such as runoff related data or data from administrative units, can with 'rtop' be interpolated to locations without observations with the top-kriging method. A description of the package is given by Skøien et al (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2014.02.009>.
